### Future Directions/Expansions: physics/simulation part of the story
The two-dimensional layer heterostructure stack hold promising applications in the electronics and fundamental physics research. To facilitate and implement the fast screening and simulation of the electronic properties for the stacks, the database tools developed here paves the groundwork for the future studies. With the infrastructure built for the material database, the data generation for various layer types can be automated. The generalization includes variations of the crystal geometry and configuration used for the simulation such as the deformations of the layer geometry from the strain perturbations, the height variations from the compressed pressure applied, various constituent atoms in the layers, etc. Massive atomic coupling information can be extracted from these simulations and the database is suitable to be used to manage the data set and to bridge other applications. For example, one might envision the machine learning algorithm developed to extract and model the feature for the atomic coupling and the dependence on the local environment. This would allow the prediction and modeling of the atomic coupling give a local configuration that appear in the stacked layers (locally). The database itself is also very useful to be used to visualize the atomic coupling depending on each orbital type, or used to derive simpler effective low-energy models for theoretical physics research. The simulation would then guide the fabrication of the devices and make the prediction of their physical properties. On the other hand, because of the layer geometry, the layer materials can also be probed by various experimental methods such as scanning tunneling microscope or optical measurements. These probing techniques directly access the electronic properties and can be used to validate the predications we have for the layer stacks. This would give the feedback for the theoretical modeling and further improve the quality for the simulation method. Our method is designed to retain the information from first principle calculations (DFT) and can be improved systematically without any unjustified ad hoc ansatz or assumptions for the atomic coupling. A database that manage the set of atomic coupling data is highly relevant for the field of studies on these two-dimensional layered materials and their simulations.
